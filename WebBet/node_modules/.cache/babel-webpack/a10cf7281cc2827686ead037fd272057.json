Additional internal compliance is also conducted to ensure other functionality around integration testing and user acceptance testing, further guaranteeing integrated games perform up to the expected user experience standard. Our games all offer unpredictable game play and possibilities of large wins and losses, but the average long term return of a game can be calculated using the Theoretical Return to Player (RTP) value using either a theoretical or simulated approach adjusted according to the game type.

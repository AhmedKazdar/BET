                            13.14. The maximum stake is dependent on the amount <a href="https://{{domain}}">{{domain}}</a> accepts

                            bet or part thereof that is subject to such manual verification. Any bet
                            that has not been manually approved before the game has started is voided
                            in full. You have the right to void any bet that is subject to manual

                            using the Theoretical Return to Player (RTP) value using either a theoretical or
                            simulated approach adjusted according to the game type. The Theoretical RTP value is as
                            suggested - a theoretical calculation disclosing expected wage percentage player return

                        <p>Gambling of all varieties has been a popular form of entertainment for many years. Here

                            that, fun. We also encourage
                            our customers, while having fun, not to allow their gambling affect their usual daily
                            routine or time spent with
                            family and friends. Making sure that the money they spend is set aside for leisure time
                            and not for other
                            purposes. It is very important not to rely on paying for life's necessities with

                            this is not guaranteed in any way.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Treat your betting and gaming as a form of entertainment and only use money that you
                                have set aside for your
                                entertainment.</li>
